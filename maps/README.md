# maps
This folder contains the object and map files which will be used to test our planner, including:
| Object      | Size               | Center          |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Wall        | x:0.3 y:5.0 z:5.0  | (3.0, 0.0, 2.5) |
|Trunk        | r:0.25 l:4         | ()              |
| Simple_maze |                    |                 |
| Square_exit |                    |                 |

There are two ways to give planners the information of the environment:
* Scene objects
* Octomap
